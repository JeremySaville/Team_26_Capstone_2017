                <Label Text="There are many possible causes of low blood sugar. When you are trying to figure out which cause applies to you, it helps to have good records of your monitoring results.

                <Label Text="The doctor explained that if too much short-acting insulin is taken, you are most likely to have a hypo around 6 hours later (but as long as 12 hours later). The doctor was also able to adjust Andrew's insulin to carb ratio and night time insulin, and now his control is much better. Because of this, he is at a much lower risk from having a hypo or being at risk from other serious diseases." FontSize="Medium" TextColor="Black"
